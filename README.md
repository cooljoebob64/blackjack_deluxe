## 🎁 Code Examples
Part of the Deck class that handles reloading the shoe, utilizing dynamic game rules
```Java
public class Deck {
  /**
   * Adds decks into the Shoe, optionally clearing beforehand according to game rules
   * Loads the number of decks specified by the game rules
   */
  public void reloadShoe() {
    // If the rules require it, clear the shoe before reloading
    if (gameRules.isClearShoeOnLoad()) {
      currentShoe.clear();
      System.out.println("Clearing shoe...");
    }

    // Determine the number of decks that must be loaded at once
    int decksToLoad = gameRules.getDecksToLoad();
    System.out.println("Reloading shoe with " + decksToLoad + " decks.");

    // For each deck that must be loaded, make a shuffled deck and add each card to the shoe
    for (int i = 0; i < decksToLoad; i++) {
      Card[] deckToLoad = getShuffledDeck();
      for (Card card : deckToLoad) {
        currentShoe.push(card);
      }
    }
  }
}
